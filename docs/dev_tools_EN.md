## Comparison for the LifeSim Chain Project

| Feature | GDevelop | Construct 3 |
|----------------|----------|-------------|
| Cost | Free (base), paid plans for advanced features | Primarily paid with trial period |
| Learning curve | Medium | Medium-low |
| Support for life simulations | Good | Good |
| Integration with external technologies | Possible | Possible |
| Mobile/web publishing | Yes | Yes |
| Community and resources | Large | Large |

## Preliminary Recommendation

For the LifeSim Chain project, **GDevelop** seems to be the most suitable choice for an initial prototype, considering:

1. Zero cost to start (important given that no budget is available)
2. The ability to publish on web and mobile platforms
3. The ability to handle complex logic through a visual interface
4. Support for multiplayer functionality that could be relevant for the social aspects of the game

However, it's important to note that to fully implement the blockchain and NFT functionalities described in the concept, it will be necessary in the future to integrate the prototype with external services or collaborate with developers specialized in these technologies.

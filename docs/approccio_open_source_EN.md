# Open Source Approach for LifeSim Chain

## Overview

Based on user feedback, we are updating our development proposal to include an open source approach for the LifeSim Chain project. This approach perfectly aligns with the principles of decentralization and transparency of blockchain technology, offering greater security and privacy to users through data fragmentation.

## Advantages of the Open Source Approach

1. **Greater transparency**
   - Users can directly verify how their data is managed
   - The code is open to public inspection, increasing trust

2. **Collaborative development**
   - Possibility to attract passionate developers who contribute to the project
   - Acceleration of development through community contributions

3. **Improved security**
   - More eyes on the code mean more opportunities to identify vulnerabilities
   - Continuous security audits by the community

4. **Alignment with blockchain values**
   - Decentralization and transparency as fundamental principles
   - Greater coherence between the technology used and the project philosophy

## License and Royalty Model

To maintain a small royalty as the project creator, we recommend adopting one of the following licenses:

1. **Modified MIT License**
   - Permissive and widely used
   - Addition of a royalty clause for commercial uses

2. **Apache 2.0 License with commercial attribution clause**
   - Robust legal protection
   - Possibility to request royalties for commercial uses

3. **Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial License**
   - Allows unrestricted non-commercial uses
   - Requires separate agreements for commercial uses

## Community Strategy

1. **Collaboration platforms**
   - Public GitHub repository with detailed documentation
   - Issue tracking system for reports and feature requests
   - Pull request process for external contributions

2. **Project governance**
   - Creation of contributor guidelines
   - Definition of a decision-making process for accepting changes
   - Maintenance of the "benevolent dictator" role as the original creator

3. **Incentives for contributors**
   - Public recognition of contributors
   - Possible royalty sharing for significant contributions
   - Bounty program for specific features or bug fixes

## Technical Implementation

1. **Modular architecture**
   - Clear separation between core engine and additional modules
   - Well-documented APIs to facilitate extension

2. **Blockchain integration**
   - Use of existing open source libraries for blockchain functionality
   - Detailed documentation of the security architecture

3. **Privacy and security**
   - Implementation of best practices for data protection
   - Use of data fragmentation techniques on blockchain

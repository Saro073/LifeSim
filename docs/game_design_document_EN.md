# Game Design Document - LifeSim Chain

## Game Overview

**Title**: LifeSim Chain

**Genre**: Life Simulation, Strategy, Blockchain

**Platforms**: Web, Mobile (Android/iOS)

**Target Demographic**: 18-45 years old, interested in life simulations, blockchain technology, and games with social impact

**Distribution Model**: Open Source with monetization possibilities through royalties

## Concept and Vision

LifeSim Chain is a life simulator that combines traditional game mechanics with blockchain technologies and artificial intelligence. The player experiences a complete virtual life, from birth to death, making decisions that affect not only their character but also future generations. Each significant choice is recorded as an NFT on the blockchain, creating a permanent digital legacy that can be passed down or traded.

### Design Philosophy

- **Meaningful Choices**: Every decision has long-term consequences
- **Generational Persistence**: Death is not the end, but the beginning of a new chapter
- **Connection Between Virtual and Real**: Integration with the real world through local partnerships
- **Transparency and Ownership**: Players truly own their data and progress

## Game Mechanics

### Life Cycle

1. **Birth and Childhood**
   - Initial characteristics influenced by the previous generation
   - Development of basic skills through educational mini-games
   - Personality formation through early choices

2. **Adolescence**
   - Educational and social choices that define the future path
   - Development of talents and passions
   - First significant relationships

3. **Adulthood**
   - Career and professional development
   - Romantic and family relationships
   - Acquisition of goods and properties
   - Moral and ethical decisions with long-term consequences

4. **Old Age**
   - Legacy management
   - Knowledge transmission to future generations
   - Preparation for generational transition

5. **Death and Succession**
   - Evaluation of the life lived
   - Distribution of inheritance (material and immaterial)
   - Transition to the next generation

### Game Modes

1. **"I Am"**
   - Realistic mode where the player is encouraged to make authentic decisions
   - AI analyzes choices to reveal psychological tendencies (with consent)
   - More reflective and personal experience

2. **"The Mask"**
   - Experimental mode where the player can explore alternative life paths
   - Possibility to create "what if" scenarios and parallel universes
   - Greater creative freedom and experimentation

### Economic System

1. **Dual Currencies**
   - **$TIME**: Daily currency for necessities and small luxuries
   - **$LEGACY**: Stablecoin-based currency for significant purchases and NFTs

2. **Goods and Properties**
   - Virtual properties with real value on the blockchain
   - Business activities that generate passive income
   - Collectible items with increasing value over time

3. **Inheritance and Succession**
   - Transfer of assets to future generations
   - Debts and obligations that persist beyond the character's death
   - Family secrets that can be discovered by subsequent generations

## Game Systems

### Adaptive AI System

Artificial intelligence observes and reacts to player choices, creating:
- Customization of challenges based on abilities and preferences
- NPCs with realistic behaviors and memories of past interactions
- Dynamic events that reflect the player's behavioral tendencies

### Blockchain System

- **Dynamic NFTs**: Game objects that evolve over time
- **Family Diary**: Immutable record of significant decisions
- **Smart Contracts**: Regulate inheritance, marriages, and other in-game agreements

### Relationship System

- Deep relationships with NPCs with complex personalities
- Family dynamics that evolve across generations
- Social networks that influence opportunities and challenges

### Immortality System

- Extreme challenge accessible only to the most dedicated players
- Requires significant moral and material sacrifices
- Profound consequences on the game ecosystem

## User Interface and UX

### Main Interface

- Minimalist and intuitive design
- Clear visualization of character status and relationships
- Interactive timeline showing past events and potential futures

### Blockchain Visualization

- Dashboard to manage NFTs and digital assets
- Visualization of the family tree with digital inheritance
- Interface for trading and exchanging assets

### Integration with the Real World

- Map that overlays virtual elements on real places
- Notification system for real-world opportunities
- QR codes to interact with local business partners

## Technical Aspects

### Open Source Architecture

- Public GitHub repository with detailed documentation
- Well-defined APIs to facilitate extension by the community
- Modularity to allow specific contributions

### Blockchain Integration

- Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Solana, Polygon)
- Abstraction layer to simplify user interaction
- Fallback system to ensure data persistence

### Security and Privacy

- Data fragmentation through blockchain technology
- Complete user control over their data
- Granular privacy options

## Monetization

### Open Source Model with Royalty

- Completely open source code base
- Small royalty for the original creator on commercial uses
- Possible royalty sharing with significant contributors

### Monetization Opportunities

- Partnerships with local businesses for in-game promotions
- Marketplace for content creators (skins, objects, scenarios)
- Optional premium services (advanced psychological analysis, additional storage)

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Base Prototype (MVP)
- Basic life cycle mechanics
- Simplified user interface
